    It’s hard to beat the mighty Matanuska for highway-accessible glacier views. The glacier is just off the 
    Glenn Highway. A large, state-maintained overlook is just off the highway. 
    Ready to stretch your legs? 
    A short, 1-mile path through a forest of quaking aspens explores the natural phenomenon of glaciers, and 
    gives trekkers other perspectives of the glacier, the Chugach Mountains above it, and the Matanuska River below it.

    **Proper Gear & Winter Visits**  
    Be sure to bring rain gear: this valley is known to trap clouds that produce everything from slow drizzles to the less-frequent (but pelting) cloudbursts.
    Forest service warns against winter travel due to steep walls of Byron Valley and high snowfall, which makes the area prone to avalanche risks.
  
  * Portage Pass Trail  
    ```
    Coordinates
    Latitude: 60.776
    Longitude: -148.7244
    ```  
    https://www.alaska.org/detail/portage-pass-trail      
    ```
    Distance: 2 miles
    Difficulty: Moderate
    ```  
    **Note**  
    ```
    One important thing to keep in mind: be sure to bring rain gear and warm clothing. No matter how clear and sunny 
    the day appears in Anchorage (or even in Girdwood), the weather may be cloudy and rainy on the other side of the 
    Whittier tunnel. Whittier, one of the wettest places in Alaska, often lies under lots of clouds, which makes for 
    potentially hypothermic conditions.

# Northern Lights
  https://www.alaska.org/things-to-do/northern-lights-viewing
  
  ```
  When do the northern lights appear? Not during the summer midnight sun, because it doesn’t get dark! 
  But from mid – August to mid-April, it’s possible to see the northern lights in Alaska.
  ```
  ## How to Increase Your Chances of Seeing the Lights?
   There’s no guarantee, of course: Clouds may cover them, or they may simply not show up in your location. Fortunately, there are a couple ways to greatly improve your chances of seeing the aurora:

  * **Plan 5 - 7 days** for your trip and dedicate at least 3 nights to looking for the lights, so that you, too, will have a 90% chance of seeing them. It can work as a three- or four-day trip centered on a weekend, but then you will need to be more focused.
  * **Go to Fairbanks and the aurora oval.** The main auroral band crosses the state in an arc north of the Alaska Range, which makes Fairbanks and the surrounding area Alaska’s sweet spot for northern lights viewing. And it’s easy to reach: You can fly into Fairbanks and be at a world-class aurora–viewing venue in under an an hour.

  **Aurora Pointe Activity Center**  
  ```
  570 Funk Road
  Fairbanks, AK 99712
  ```
  https://www.alaska.org/detail/aurora-pointe-activity-center  
  Witnessing the colorful, dramatic Northern Lights is an iconic Alaskan winter experience. Look for the lights at the Aurora Pointe Activity Center, just **15 minutes from downtown Fairbanks**—it’s a fun and informative way to enjoy this very unique natural phenomenon.

# Visiting Denali
  https://www.nps.gov/dena/planyourvisit/visiting-denali.htm
  
   ````
   During summer, roughly late May through early September, private vehicles may drive the first fifteen miles of this road, 
   to a place called Savage River. The road to Savage River is paved, and features numerous pull-outs for folks to stop and 
   snap some scenic photos. "The Mountain" can be seen as early as Mile 9, if the day isn't too overcast, and animals of all 
   sorts can sometimes be seen on this stretch of road - although chances to see wildlife increase greatly with a bus trip 
   farther down the Park Road. Beyond the Savage River Check Station at mile 15 of the Park Road, you'll need to be on a bus, 
   bicycle, or on foot.

   ## Exploring Denali by Bus
   Types of Bus Trips: `Tour` vs. `Transit`  

   You should understand the nature of bus trips in Denali before booking anything.

   There are two main types of buses in Denali - narrated trips (tour buses) and non-narrated trips (transit buses). In addition, a few free buses travel routes around the park entrance, connecting visitor centers and points of interest in the same area where visitors may drive their own vehicles.

  `Non-narrated transit buses`  
  https://www.nps.gov/dena/planyourvisit/shuttles.htm  
  https://www.nps.gov/dena/planyourvisit/upload/shuttle-schedule.pdf  
  Cheaper than tour buses, and more flexible in that you may disembark / re-board anywhere along the road, these are called transit buses. Transit bus drivers aim to help you   experience the park on your own terms. These buses stop for wildlife viewing, restroom stops and beautiful scenery, just like tour buses. There are four choices of non-narrated trips, of varying length.

  `Narrated tour buses`  
  https://www.nps.gov/dena/planyourvisit/bus-tours.htm  
  Your driver is your narrator on the tour buses, and he or she will provide a detailed and captivating program to accompany your journey along the Denali Park Road. Tour buses make the same restroom stops as the non-narrated buses, and of course will pause for views of wildlife and scenery. All tours offer either a snack or full lunch. There are three tour bus options, of varying length.

  `Free buses`  
  https://www.nps.gov/dena/planyourvisit/courtesy-shuttle-buses.htm  
  Three types of free buses operate on the publicly-driveable portion of the Denali Park Road. These enable visitors without vehicles, or those who wish to leave their vehicle behind, to travel between various facilities, trails, campgrounds and day-use areas. All of these are free, and none require reservations.
