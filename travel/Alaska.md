````
During summer, roughly late May through early September, private vehicles may drive the first fifteen miles of this road, 
to a place called Savage River. The road to Savage River is paved, and features numerous pull-outs for folks to stop and 
snap some scenic photos. "The Mountain" can be seen as early as Mile 9, if the day isn't too overcast, and animals of all 
sorts can sometimes be seen on this stretch of road - although chances to see wildlife increase greatly with a bus trip 
farther down the Park Road. Beyond the Savage River Check Station at mile 15 of the Park Road, you'll need to be on a bus, 
bicycle, or on foot.

## Exploring Denali by Bus
Types of Bus Trips: `Tour` vs. `Transit`  

You should understand the nature of bus trips in Denali before booking anything.

There are two main types of buses in Denali - narrated trips (tour buses) and non-narrated trips (transit buses). In addition, a few free buses travel routes around the park entrance, connecting visitor centers and points of interest in the same area where visitors may drive their own vehicles.

Cheaper than tour buses, and more flexible in that you may disembark / re-board anywhere along the road, these are called transit buses. Transit bus drivers aim to help you experience the park on your own terms. These buses stop for wildlife viewing, restroom stops and beautiful scenery, just like tour buses. There are four choices of non-narrated trips, of varying length.

Your driver is your narrator on the tour buses, and he or she will provide a detailed and captivating program to accompany your journey along the Denali Park Road. Tour buses make the same restroom stops as the non-narrated buses, and of course will pause for views of wildlife and scenery. All tours offer either a snack or full lunch. There are three tour bus options, of varying length.

`Free buses`

Three types of free buses operate on the publicly-driveable portion of the Denali Park Road. These enable visitors without vehicles, or those who wish to leave their vehicle behind, to travel between various facilities, trails, campgrounds and day-use areas. All of these are free, and none require reservations.
